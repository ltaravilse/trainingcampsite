                        <p>The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the oldest and most important programming contest in the world. This competition, organized by the Association for Computer Machinery (ACM), is divided in three phases.</p>

                        <p>In the first phase, each university chooses their teams for the next phase. This phase is optional and most universities in Argentina use the Torneo Argentino de Programaci√≥n (TAP) for choosing their teams.</p>

                        <p>The second phase of the competition is the regional contests. Latin America is divided into 5 regions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>South America/South (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay).</li>
                            <li>South America/North (Colombia and Venezuela).</li>
                            <li>Brazil.</li>
                            <li>Mexico and Central America.</li>
                            <li>Caribe.</li>
                        </ul>
